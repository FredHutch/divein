<h2>Identify clusters in a phylogeny</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Uses a variation on the method of AFY Poon et al
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
cluster_by_patristic_distance(tree, min_size = 5, distance_threshold = 0.02)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>tree</code></td>
<td>
<p>A phylogenetic tree of the phylo class</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>min_size</code></td>
<td>
<p>Minimum size of components to report as clusters</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>distance_threshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>Pairwise patristic distance between taxa not
exceeding this threshold will be clustered together</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>As originally described, the adjacency matrix of the clustering graph is
derived not from a single tree, but from 100 trees built from 100 bootstrap-
sampled alignments. Patristic distance between taxa is calculated for each
tree, and only those taxa below the threshold in a majority of trees have an
edge in the final graph.
</p>
<p>The default distance threshold of 0.02 substitutions/base is an empirically
chosen value specific to the BC work by Poon et al., and is used here by
way of example and not with any particular claim to quality
(doi:10.1093/infdis/jiu560).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A named numeric vector; the names are taxa labels from the tree, the
values are the component of the clustering graph the named taxon is
connected to, if the component size is at least <code>min_size</code>
